                    <p>There are several rules ( applied in this order ) :
                    <div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>inline css ( html style attribute ) overrides css rules in style tag and css file</li>
                            <li>a more specific selector takes precedence over a less specific one</li>
                            <li>rules that appear later in the code override earlier rules if both have the same specificity.</li>
                            <li>A css rule with !important always takes precedence.</li>
